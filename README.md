# Data Analysis: Correlation and Linear Regression 📉

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between students' stress scores and their maximum alcohol consumption using linear regression and correlation analysis. The objective is to quantify and understand the nature of this relationship using statistical methods.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Correlation Analysis**: Determine the strength and direction of the relationship between two continuous variables.
- **Linear Regression**: Model the relationship using a linear regression approach to predict outcomes and interpret the regression coefficients.
- **Visualization**: Use scatterplots and residual plots to visualize data trends and regression accuracy.

## 🔍 Methods Used
- **Scatterplot with Regression Line**: Visualizing the relationship between stress scores and alcohol consumption to observe trends and fit.
- **Correlation Coefficient Calculation**: Quantifying the linear relationship between the variables.
- **Regression Analysis**: Using linear models to understand and predict stress scores based on alcohol consumption levels.

## 📈 Results
- The correlation coefficient of 0.326 indicates a low to moderate positive linear relationship.
- The linear regression model formulated was `Stress Score = 18.0504 + 0.4244 * Maximum Alcohol`, suggesting that as alcohol consumption increases, so does the stress score, albeit weakly.
- The model explains approximately 10.65% of the variance in stress scores based on alcohol consumption.

## 📝 Conclusions
The analysis highlights a statistically significant but weak positive relationship between alcohol consumption and stress scores among students. This suggests that while alcohol consumption can predict stress scores to some extent, other factors likely play a significant role in influencing stress levels.
